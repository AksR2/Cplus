Huffman Encoder and Decoder in C++

This project demonstrates my love for C++. I've implemented this project as part of my advance data structures course work.

*The code has an encoder.cpp and a decoder.cpp which are the two main files for this project. 
*The encoder (using huffman encoding scheme) encodes a list of numbers to achieve comperessions.
*The decoder then uses the encoder table and the encoded.bin file to decompress to restore the original contents.
